# LinkedIn Ads Deep Analysis

Audit LinkedIn Ads for B2B advertising effectiveness — 25 weighted checks across technical setup, audience targeting, creative quality, lead gen forms, and bidding strategy, including Thought Leader Ads, ABM, and predictive audiences.

> Core skill canon (Phase 4). Merged from .claude/commands/cmo/distribution/ads/ads-linkedin/SKILL.md (rich) + skills-core/skills/paid-media/ads-linkedin.md (portable stub) on 2026-07-02.

**When to use:** When the user says "LinkedIn Ads", "B2B ads", "sponsored content", "lead gen forms", "InMail", or "LinkedIn campaign".

## Process

1. Collect LinkedIn Ads data (Campaign Manager export, Insight Tag status, CRM sync notes, lead gen forms, audiences, and creative examples)
2. Read `tools/ads-references/linkedin-audit.md` for full 25-check audit
3. Read `tools/ads-references/benchmarks.md` for LinkedIn-specific benchmarks
4. Read `tools/ads-references/scoring-system.md` for weighted scoring
5. Evaluate all applicable checks as PASS, WARNING, or FAIL
6. Calculate LinkedIn Ads Health Score (0-100)
7. Generate findings report with action plan

## What to Analyze

### Technical Setup (25% weight)
- Insight Tag installed and firing on all pages (L01)
- Conversions API (CAPI) active — launched 2025 (L02)
- Conversion events configured for full funnel
- Revenue attribution tracking enabled
- CRM sync in place for conversion and lead data

### Audience Targeting (25% weight)
- Job title targeting uses specific titles, not just functions (L03)
- Company size filtering matches ICP (L04)
- Seniority level appropriate for offer (L05)
- Matched Audiences active: retargeting + contact lists (L06)
- ABM company lists uploaded (up to 300,000 companies) (L07)
- Audience expansion OFF for precision campaigns, ON for scale (L08)
- Predictive audiences tested — replaced Lookalikes Feb 2024 (L09)
- Exclusions applied (existing customers, competitors, irrelevant segments)

### Creative Quality (20% weight)
- Thought Leader Ads active, ≥30% budget allocation for B2B (L10)
- Ad format diversity: ≥2 formats tested (L11)
- Video ads tested (L12)
- Creative refresh every 4-6 weeks (L13)
- Document ads considered where gated/ungated content fits the funnel
- Offer quality matches audience stage

### Lead Gen & Performance (15% weight)
- Lead Gen Form ≤5 fields (13% CVR benchmark) (L14)
- Lead Gen Form synced to CRM in real-time (L15)
- Form field quality: fields capture qualification data, not just contact info
- Campaign objective matches funnel stage (L18)
- A/B testing active: creative or audience (L19)
- Message ad frequency ≤1 per 30-45 days (L20)
- CPL tracked alongside downstream quality metrics

### Bidding & Budget (15% weight)
- Bid strategy: CPS for Messages, Max Delivery for Content (L16)
- Daily budget ≥$50 for Sponsored Content (L17)
- CTR ≥0.44% for Sponsored Content (L21)

## Thought Leader Ads (TLA) Assessment

Thought Leader Ads use employee/executive personal posts as sponsored content:
- CPC typically $2.29-$4.14 vs $13.23 for standard Sponsored Content
- CTR typically 2-3x higher than corporate-branded ads
- Best for: B2B thought leadership, brand awareness, engagement

Evaluate:
- Are TLAs being used? (If not, HIGH priority recommendation)
- Are they getting ≥30% of total LinkedIn budget?
- Are the right employees selected (industry credibility, active posters)?
- Is post content authentic and valuable (not salesy)?

## ABM Strategy Assessment

For B2B Enterprise accounts:
- Company list uploaded and segmented by tier (Tier 1, 2, 3)
- Custom content per tier (personalized messaging)
- Account penetration tracking (contacts reached per target account)
- Integration with CRM/ABM platform (Demandbase, 6sense, etc.)
